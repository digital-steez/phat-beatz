# phat-beatz: Simple playlist generator for Facebook music groups

phat-beatz scrapes Facebook, YouTube and SoundCloud's APIs to generate a data file consisting of all tracks shared to a music group. It stores this as a JSON file, which is then served using json-server and consumed by a simple playlist web app built using PopcornJS and jQuery.
